# DNS-Manager
The DNS Manager All-in-One program allows users to manage their DNS settings in a single interface. Users can add, edit, and delete DNS entries on one page. Additionally, they can assign a selected DNS to a chosen adapter, displaying the configured DNS on the adapter and providing information on the connection status to the internet.

You can download the latest version from [Here](https://github.com/Hidden-M/DNS-Manager/releases/latest)
